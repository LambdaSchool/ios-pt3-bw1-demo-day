## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

    Really the whole thing. I had to completely overhaul the app at the last minute and I am happy with how to persistence is split away from the timer, and accessing deeper properties to fulfill the same task.

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    the whole thing! I found that my original plan included multithreading and a lot of strong references that with my level of knowledge I could not complete in the time limit. 23 hours left on the clock and I had to rework everything from the ground up and a bit of refactoring!
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

    https://github.com/LambdaSchool/ios-pt3-bw1-countdown-tracker-joseph/blob/master/Countdown/Countdown/View%20Controllers/UserNoteInfoController.swift
    
    this was a very different controller using data that was split from the timer itself.
  
4. What is your elevator pitch? (30 second description your Grandma or a 5-year old would understand)

    this app is made to where you can write notes or stories and be sure you dont spend too much time, or spend just the right amount of time writing.
  
5. What is your #1 feature?

    The timer!
  
6. What are you future goals?

    timer persistence/live cell updates on saved timer state.

## Required Slides (Add your Keynote to your PR)

1. App Name / Team Slide

## Slide Requirements

1. 50 pt font minimum
2. Be concise — don't write sentences/paragraphs (put these in your slide notes for speaking)
3. 3-6 bullets maximum per slide

6. Images are always welcome
7. Do the Grandma Test (Would your Grandma understand you?)

### Optional Slides
